I still remember what my mom said to me every night:  "Kid keep studying so you don't have to work as hard as I have to do."

Well I kept studing but I don't think I work less harder that my mom used to do. Been a developer is a really hard work, full of frustrations and long hours. If so why I still want to turn into a really good software developer. 

It is a great moment to be a programmer, we are surrounded for hundreds of devices and there is software everywhere. From the editor that I am using, the radio, cell phone, clock ... 

Been a developer on this world means understand it.  Be aware that behide of any bit that is comming from the internet cable are hundreds of men-hours from developers as me, which are working the best they can to build a more interconnected world. 

At the end we are trying to prove that the hole world is just a click of distance.
